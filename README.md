# OSx application settings

We all ended up that moment of when restoring OS or having a new computer, we download the applications over again and re-configuring as before.

`Let's stop wasting time` and be focus on other stuff.

Therefore this project goal is to enable settings backup and restore for different system applications and configurations.


# Applications supported

This list will grow with time and as much as needed :)

* iTerm2
* Sublime Text 3
* Visual Studio Code
* ZSHRC


# Usage

On each application diretory you can find two main scripts:

`copy-settings.sh` - copies the settings file from your application to this repository, overwriting the existing one. 

`export-settings.sh` - restores the settings file this repository to the application settings directory, overwriting the existing one if any.
